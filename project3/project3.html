        <h2>The Importance of Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Responsive web design is ideal because it allows a single web page to adapt or "respond" to the platform on which it is viewed. For instance, it allows a single experience to adapt to a variety of screen sizes and to the needs of a desktop, mobile phone, or other device such as a video game console. Users can appreciate a site which will be comfortable to view no matter where they need it. </p>

    <h2>Three Kinds of Reports That Will Explain the Information Your Audience is Accessing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Active Users Report: A type of report that shows how users interact with a website across a given length of time (day, week, month, etc.). </li>
      <li>Behavior Flow Report: A type of report that showcases how users have navivigated the website through their clicks since initially accessing it. The data gained from this type of report can be used to optimize webpages and create a better user experience going onward.</li>
      <li>Real Time Reporting: This type of reporting is nearly instantaneous. It allows developers to keep tabs with the current users of the site and can provide valuable insight into how the website is doing at that moment in time, which can then be used to ensure that it does even better in the future. </li>
