  <h2>Search Engines</h2>
  <p>Search engines work by using crawlers to index the internet and ranking individual pages by relevancy (as well as language and location), so that it can then match that content with a user’s search and return results which appropriately answer the search query originally typed by that user into the search bar.</p>

  <h3>Keywords and Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Keywords and descriptions are important for Search Engine Optimization or “SEO” as they help to describe the content of the page to the search engine and its users. Good keywords and descriptions can help to improve the webpage’s perceived relevancy and direct more traffic from web searches on to the site.</p>

  <h4>Writing Relevant Content Links</h4>
  <p>The four pillars or writing relevant content links:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Links to a webpage should come organically by creating high quality content.</li>
    <li>Links should be relevant and link to pages which have elements in common.</li>
    <li>Generate descriptive anchor text while keeping the content fresh across several iterations.</li>
    <li>Build links the actual audience would find value in, not just Google or other search engines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Good Heading Heiarchy</h5>
  <p>There are 6 headings available within HTML (h1-h6) which can be used to create a sense heiarchy within a page. Each of these six headings should be used only once per page, with the h1 heading used to represent that which is most important and thus is first in the heiarchy. </p>
